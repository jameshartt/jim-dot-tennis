  "description": "Complete the deferred WI-008 from Sprint 001. Build a cross-division selection overview that shows captains which players have been selected for which fixtures across all divisions. This prevents double-selection of players and gives captains visibility into availability gaps. The hierarchical selection model (Division 1 picks first) means lower division captains need to see who's already taken.",

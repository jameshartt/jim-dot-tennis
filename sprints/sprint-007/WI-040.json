It still references Go 1.24+, doesn't mention the Sprint 003 service refactor (12 domain-specific service files), new admin routes (users, sessions, divisions), Sprint 004 Makefile targets, or the venue/club infrastructure from Sprint 002. This work item updates CLAUDE.md to be an accurate reference for AI agents working on the codebase.",

  "description": "Run gofmt and goimports across the entire codebase to ensure consistent formatting and import organisation. gofmt enforces the canonical Go formatting style, while goimports additionally groups and sorts imports into standard library, external, and internal groups. This is a zero-risk operation that changes only whitespace and import ordering.",

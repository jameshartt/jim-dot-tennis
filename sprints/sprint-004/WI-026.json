  "description": "Run go mod tidy to remove unused dependencies from go.mod and go.sum, and ensure all required dependencies are explicitly listed. Also review go.mod for any outdated or unnecessary dependencies that could be removed or updated. This keeps the dependency tree clean and the module files accurate.",

  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "go mod tidy produces no changes (already clean after running)",
    "No unused dependencies remain in go.mod",

    "approach": [
      "1. Run go mod tidy inside Docker and check for changes",
      "2. Review go.mod for any obviously unused or redundant dependencies",
      "3. Run go mod verify to ensure integrity",
      "4. Build and verify the application still works"

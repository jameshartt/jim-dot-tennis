# User Experience Requirements

## Core User Experience Principles

1. **Simplicity First**
   - All interfaces must be intuitive enough for users with minimal technical proficiency
   - Reduce cognitive load by limiting options and focusing on core functionality
   - Use progressive disclosure for advanced features

2. **Mobile-Optimized Design**
   - Design for mobile-first, ensuring all features work well on smaller screens
   - Touch-friendly interface elements (buttons, inputs, etc.)
   - Responsive layouts that adapt to any device size

3. **Minimal Friction**
   - Reduce the number of steps required to complete common tasks
   - Automate repetitive actions wherever possible
   - Maintain state to prevent data loss and redundant input
